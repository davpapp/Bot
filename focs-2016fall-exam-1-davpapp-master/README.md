## Get the files (Terminal)

Clone your copy of the repository to your laptop by running the following commands. (Be sure to replace the GitHub user id with your own.) These instructions assume that you want to put the exam directory in your home directory (~). If not, make sure to modify the first line to change to the directory where you want the exam directory to reside.

	$ cd ~
	$ git clone git@github.com:focs16fall/focs-2016fall-exam-1-userid.git

## Take the exam

You may take this exam at a time and place of your convenience. However, you should treat this exam as a (self-administered) closed book in-class examination rather than a take-home; it is intended to be completed in single sitting lasting approximately 1.5 hours, though you may want to leave yourself extra time in case we misjudged.

The exam is in [FOCS_F2016_Exam_1.pdf](./FOCS_F2016_Exam_1.pdf). The first page gives detailed instructions.

## Submit your answers (Terminal)

	$ cd ~/focs-exam-1
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m 'exam 1 submission'
	$ git push origin master

You may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password.

Visit https://github.com/focs16fall/focs-2016fall-exam-1-userid (where userid is your GitHub user id), and verify that your submission is visible.
